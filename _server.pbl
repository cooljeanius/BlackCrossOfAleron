description="Dark forces are stirring in the land of Sharnough. An elvish school for druids on the isle of Aleron comes under attack by goblins. It seems more than just a routine raid; is there something more sinister behind this attack?

(mild spoilers for first scenario may follow)

In The Black Cross of Aleron, you control EÃ¤rendil, the surviving teacher at the school, and the many and varied initiates. Not all of these are ordinary students; many have been experimenting with other forms of magic, while others are simply overachievers in some area of study. Unfortunately, they are not especially good at combat, at least initially. Together with a very small contingent of surviving guards, it is up to these students to save the land of Sharnough from disaster."
