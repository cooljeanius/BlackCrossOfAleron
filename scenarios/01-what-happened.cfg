			story=_"It has been nearly a year since Eärendil first came to the isle of Aleron as a teacher. At first, it had been nostalgic, remembering her time as a student here in the druid citadel, decades ago; but by now, she was fully into the routine of teaching. It was nice, imparting her skills upon the young elf maidens who had come here to learn the art, and despite the small complement of trained guards stationed nearby, it felt secluded, safe from any occasional turmoil that might strike upon the land of Sharnough."
